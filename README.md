# Word Wizard
Word Wizard is a command line application I decided to create, this application was made primarily to better understand working with apis. The API used within this application at the moment is [Datamuse API](https://datamuse.com/api/). This application currently allows users to select between synonyms and antonyms for their given word, in future generations of this application I hope to add more features such as a working dictionary and a better laid out menu that splits the application clearly between Dictionary and Thesaurus while still keeping it simple and easy to understand.
